Leaflet-Polymer-Angular
=======================

This project was an experiment regarding the use of angular two-way
data-binding together with polymer at a polymer hackathon at inovex in
Karlsruhe, Germany. The example application that resulted is a very rudimentary
google maps clone, using the leaflet polymer web-component.

Take a look at the [demo](http://ajaegle.github.io/leaflet-polymer-angular).
